- Why

	- Maintenance is by far the most expensive phase of any project.

- How

	- _Be_ the maintainer.
	- Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code is a violent psychopath who knows where you live.
	- Always code and comment in such a way that if someone a few notches junior picks up the code, they will take pleasure in reading and learning from it.
