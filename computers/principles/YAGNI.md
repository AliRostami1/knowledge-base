YAGNI is an acronym for **"You Aren't Gonna Need It"**

The YAGNI principle highlights the significance of simply implementing the essential features during software development as opposed to making an effort to foresee and include every potential feature that might be required in the future. Developers can not only reduce needless complexity but also minimize possibilities of mistakes and flaws by abiding by this guideline.

- Why

	- Any work that's only used for a feature that's needed tomorrow, means losing effort from features that need to be done for the current iteration.
	- It leads to code bloat; the software becomes larger and more complicated.

- How

	- Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.
