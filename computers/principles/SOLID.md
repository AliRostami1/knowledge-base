The SOLID principles were first introduced by the famous Computer Scientist Robert J. Martin (a.k.a Uncle Bob) in his [paper](https://fi.ort.edu.uy/innovaportal/file/2032/1/design_principles.pdf) in 2000. But the SOLID acronym was introduced later by Michael Feathers.

SOLID is a list of 5 software engineering principles. It is a meta acronym where each letter corresponds to another acronym:
- [[The Single Responsibility Principle]]
- [[The Open-Closed Principle]]
- [[The Liskov Substitution Principle]]
- [[The Interface Segregation Principle]]
- [[The Dependency Inversion Principle]]
